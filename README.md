Quiver Thesis
=============

This is a bachelor thesis by [Soares Chen](https://github.com/soareschen) on the architecture behind [Quiver.js](http://quiverjs.org), a server-side component framework.

The thesis was based on an older version of Quiver, which has callback-based API and written in ES5. The latest Quiver libraries have been rewritten in ES6 and has promise based control flow. The Quiver [component system](https://github.com/quiverjs/quiverjs/wiki/Component-System) has also been completely revamped from the original component system designed in this thesis.

Other than that, the foundation [architecture constructs](https://github.com/quiverjs/quiverjs/wiki/Architecture-Constructs) presented in this thesis have largely remain the same, other than switching to promise-based control flow.
